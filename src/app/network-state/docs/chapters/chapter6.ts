            heading: 'Beyond Extractive Capitalism',
            content: `The prevailing economic model of our era—surveillance capitalism, platform monopoly, financial extraction—is fundamentally incompatible with human flourishing. It treats people as resources to be mined rather than beings to be empowered. It concentrates wealth in ever-fewer hands while degrading the commons that sustains us all.

The Utility Network proposes an alternative: an economic model designed for **circulation rather than extraction**, for **abundance rather than scarcity**, for **stakeholder value rather than shareholder primacy**.

This is not communism—we believe in markets, property rights, and the profit motive. But we believe these mechanisms should serve human ends, not the reverse. Markets are tools, not gods. Property is a social convention, not a natural right. Profit is a signal, not a purpose.

Our economic model is designed to align individual incentives with collective welfare, to distribute the gains from cooperation broadly rather than narrowly, and to build long-term value rather than extract short-term rents.`

            heading: 'The Network Token: $UTIL',
            content: `At the heart of our economic model is **$UTIL**, the native token of The Utility Network. $UTIL serves multiple functions:

**Medium of Exchange**: $UTIL is accepted across all network subsidiaries for goods and services. Citizens can transact in $UTIL without leaving the network economy.

**Unit of Account**: Prices within the network are denominated in $UTIL, providing a common standard for value comparison.

**Store of Value**: $UTIL is designed to maintain purchasing power over time through careful monetary policy and real economic backing.

**Governance Stake**: Holding $UTIL grants voting rights in network governance. More stake means more influence—but quadratic voting mechanisms prevent plutocratic domination.

**Access Token**: Some network services require $UTIL holdings for access. Higher tiers of citizenship require higher stakes.

**$UTIL is not a speculative asset** designed for pumping and dumping. It is a functional currency designed to facilitate real economic activity. Its value derives from the goods and services it can purchase, not from greater-fool dynamics.

Token distribution is designed for broad ownership:
- 30% to early contributors and founders (vested over 4 years)
- 30% to community through airdrops and incentive programs
- 20% to treasury for network development
- 20% reserved for future partnerships and acquisitions`

            heading: 'Revenue Streams',
            content: `The Utility Network generates revenue through diverse channels, providing resilience against market fluctuations:

**1. SaaS Subscriptions**
BasaltHQ and other software subsidiaries charge recurring fees for access to AI-powered business tools. Pricing is tiered based on usage and features, with discounts for $UTIL payment.

**2. Transaction Fees**
DigiBazaar charges a small percentage (1-3%) on marketplace transactions. Osiris Protocol takes fees on DeFi operations. These fees are substantially lower than centralized alternatives.

**3. Physical Goods**
The Graine Ledger sells tokenized whiskey barrels. Cornucopia Robotics sells produce and agricultural products. As the network grows, physical product lines will expand.

**4. Energy Sales**
Requiem Electric sells surplus power to local grids and directly to customers. Long-term power purchase agreements provide stable, recurring revenue.

**5. Citizenship Fees**
Citizens pay a nominal annual fee ($100-500 depending on tier) to maintain network infrastructure and services. This is not a tax—it is a voluntary contribution that citizens can avoid by exiting.

**6. Investment Returns**
Treasury funds are invested in yield-generating assets within and outside the network. Conservative investment policies prioritize capital preservation over aggressive returns.

Revenue distribution follows constitutional guidelines:
- 40% to operating expenses and salaries
- 30% to research, development, and expansion
- 20% to treasury reserves
- 10% to citizen dividends`

            heading: 'Treasury Management',
            content: `The network's collective wealth is held in a **multi-signature treasury** controlled by elected trustees. All treasury operations are recorded on-chain and publicly auditable.

**Spending Authority**:
- Routine expenses (under $10,000): Executive officer approval
- Moderate expenses ($10,000-$100,000): Finance committee approval
- Major expenses ($100,000+): Full citizen vote

**Investment Policy**:
- At least 50% in stable assets (USD, stablecoins, bonds)
- Up to 30% in yield-generating protocols (staking, lending)
- Up to 20% in growth assets (network tokens, strategic investments)

**Risk Management**:
- Multi-sig requires 3 of 5 signatures for any transaction
- Cold storage for majority of assets
- Regular security audits by independent firms
- Insurance against smart contract failures

**Transparency**:
- Real-time dashboard showing treasury balances
- Quarterly financial reports reviewed by community
- Annual third-party audit published publicly

The treasury is the **collective patrimony** of all citizens. Its prudent management is a sacred trust that trustees breach at peril of removal and reputation loss.`

            heading: 'The Economic Flywheel',
            content: `The network economy is designed as a **flywheel**—a self-reinforcing cycle where each component strengthens the others:

1. **Value Creation**: Subsidiaries create genuine economic value through products and services.

2. **Revenue Generation**: Value creation generates revenue in $UTIL and external currencies.

3. **Treasury Growth**: Revenue flows to treasury after covering expenses.

4. **Investment**: Treasury invests in expanding network infrastructure and capabilities.

5. **Capability Expansion**: Investment creates new services that attract more citizens.

6. **Network Growth**: More citizens means larger markets for all subsidiaries.

7. **Value Increase**: Larger markets mean more value creation, completing the cycle.

This flywheel creates **compounding returns** over time. Early citizens benefit from the growth that later citizens enable, but later citizens still have access to an increasingly valuable network. Unlike zero-sum extraction, this is a **positive-sum game** where all participants can benefit.

The key to the flywheel is **real value creation**. We are not simply moving money around; we are building things that make people's lives better. This is the sustainable foundation for long-term growth.`
