        tucAdvantage: 'TUC integrates IoT not just as data points, but as active economic agents (Robot-to-Robot economy). Our "Cornucopia Robotics" and "Requiem Electric" subsidiaries apply this directly to specific verticals like AgTech and Energy, going beyond just the protocol layer.',

        category: 'RWA',
        description: 'Centrifuge bridges real-world assets like invoices to DeFi liquidity.',
        tucAdvantage: 'Centrifuge is excellent for credit. TUC expands RWA to operational equity and community utilities. Through "The Graine Ledger" and "Loch Ness," we tokenize the actual productive output (whiskey, crops), creating a deeper connection between asset and utility.',

        description: 'Securitize focuses on the compliant issuance and trading of digital securities.',
        tucAdvantage: 'Securitize is the platform; TUC is the ecosystem. We use compliant standards but wrap them in engaging, consumer-facing brands (like Elysium or DigiBazaar), driving actual user adoption rather than just providing the plumbing.',

        category: 'Enterprise',
        description: 'IBM offers permissioned blockchain solutions for enterprise supply chains.',
        tucAdvantage: 'IBM solutions are often heavy, expensive, and top-down. TUC offers "Industrial Automation as a Service" which is modular, community-driven, and designed to empower smaller stakeholders alongside major enterprises.',

        tucAdvantage: 'Chainlink moves data. TUC moves value. We integrate oracles deeply into the industrial control loop. Our "Edge Oracles" run directly on the machine PLC, not just in the cloud, offering lower latency and higher security for physical automation.',

        tucAdvantage: 'Polygon is a general-purpose chain. TUC builds application-specific rollups (AppChains). Our chains are custom-tuned for specific industrial needs—high throughput for energy, privacy for pharma—rather than sharing bandwidth with meme coins.',

        tucAdvantage: 'Stripe takes 2.9% + 30c. TUC takes fractions of a penny. For high-volume, low-value machine-to-machine micropayments (like paying for a single API call or a watt of power), Stripe is economically unviable. TUC is the only path forward.',
